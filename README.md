# Enigma
Enigma - Self Evaluation Rubric

Functionality - 3

   My enigma class with encrypt and decrypt methods is fully functioning. My CLI
   with encrypt and decrypt is successfully implemented. Note: The runner files
   are called encrypt_runner.rb and decrypt_runner.rb

Object Oriented Programming - 3

   I have 5 classes and one module all with a single responsibility. I have only one method
   in my module that is over 7 lines, its 8 lines long. All of my classes are under 20 lines,
   with the exception of my enigma class which is 37. My Cypher module is 70. My naming is
   clear and understandable.

Test Driven Development - 3

   Every method is test both at the unit and integration level. I have 100% coverage in simplecov.
   Tests were always committed first with the exception of helper methods that were written
   in refactoring. Those test were always committed before the method was written

Version Control - 3

   I have 50 commits and 14 pull requests (15 after this md.) I always committed tests first,
   And never committed more than 3 methods at a time. Tests were committed all at once.
